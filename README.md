# Towards a Weather-Aware Traffic Model using Deep Belief Networks and Data Fusion Techniques

There are three traffic models: Prediction Model 1 (PM1), Prediction Model 2 (PM2) and the Fusion Center (FC)
PM1 is fed with historical traffic data, and predicts traffic condition of timestep t+1
PM2 is fed with historical weather data, and predicts traffic condition of timestep t+1
FC is fed with the predicted traffic conditions of PM1 and PM2, and predicts traffic condition of timestep t+1
